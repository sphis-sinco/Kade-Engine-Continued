# Building

**Also note**: you should be familiar with the commandline. If not, read this [quick guide by ninjamuffin](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480).

**Also also note**: To build for _Windows_, you need to be on _Windows_. To build for _Linux_, you need to be on _Linux_. Same goes for macOS. You can build for html5/browsers on any platform.
