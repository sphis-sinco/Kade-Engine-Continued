# Indie Edition

Boredom and being petty and not wanting to have modern quality of life features unless I add them myself.
And also a minecraft java edition kinda thing for FNF seemed cool to me so yeah

[DOCS](./docs/README.md)

## Note

I don't call it "Indie Edition" as some sort of "FNF isn't indie anymore" kinda thing, I just find indie projects to be the cool things held together by duct tape.

Like something you would've made with cardboard as a kid.
